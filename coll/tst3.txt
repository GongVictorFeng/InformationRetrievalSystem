   A high school principal has resigned two
weeks after allowing a student to take a college entrance exam in
his son's name.
   Hempstead High School Principal Cliff Gilliard, who maintained he
was trying to make a point about lax security at exam sites,
submitted his letter of resignation Tuesday and was reassigned to a
teaching position.
   Superintendent Bill G. Caesar had said he did not believe
Gilliard's story.
   ``It's funny how one mistake erases all the good you've tried to
do in your life,'' Gilliard wrote in his resignation letter.
``Please let the school board know I'm truly sorry for the
embarrassment I've caused the school district.''
   Gilliard told the Houston Chronicle last week that he wanted to
test what he believed was loose security when he provided a student
with a fake ID to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
   The ID bore the name Reginald ``Bo'' Gilliard and the other
student's photo. After the test was completed, Gilliard said, he
wrote the College Board and canceled the results.
   ``They have to understand that this thing is happening every
day,'' said Gilliard, who has been with the district about eight
years. ``It's unfair to the youngsters.''

   Frigid, foggy weather and problems in the Soviet
supply line cost rescuers vital time today in their race to supply
Armenian earthquake survivors with food, medicine and shelter.
   All flights between Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and the
disaster area were halted by rain, snow and fog, and the forecast
was worsening. The weekend is expected to bring more snow and up to
45 mph winds.
   About 5,400 people have been pulled from buildings wrecked in the
Dec. 7 quake, which officials say killed at least 55,000 people,
injured 13,000 and left 500,000 people homeless.
   The survivors ``are almost totally isolated in the cold,'' said
Dr. Bernard Mankikian, who returned to Paris after visiting Spitak,
a city that was destroyed by the quake.
   The communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Capt.
Sergei Bobylev as saying in one village that ``survivors are dying
from cold.''
   Trucks were struggling over snowy mountain passes to bring tents
and blankets to survivors, racing the onset of even worse weather.
   At least two relief planes bound for Armenia, a French Red Cross
plane with medical gear and a Belgian plane were held up in Moscow
early today due to fog in Yerevan.
   At the airport in Spitak, ``a huge quantity of goods desperately
needed in the disaster areas has piled up,'' the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda said.
   It said there was no regular supply of hot food to survivors and
that there were difficulties providing tents to survivors and
rescuers. Villages around Spitak, near the epicenter of the quake,
were among the hardest-hit places.
   George Reid, a spokesman for the Geneva-based League of Red Cross
and Red Crescent societies, said in Yerevan that Soviet officials
had asked for tents to set up housing and emergency medical services
in 48 villages.
   Soviet television on Tuesday night showed rows of tents near the
ruins of the town of Stepanavan, but it said many more were needed.
   ``There are not enough tents,'' the commentator said.
   In its Tuesday editions, Pravda gave the first indications that
looting and other crimes were becoming a problem in the disaster
area, reporting break-in attempts at a jewelry store and apartments
and the slaying of one person.
   It also said helmeted soldiers wearing bulletproof vests had
taken up positions in the streets of Leninakan to keep order.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, head of earthquake relief, said on
Monday that a ``special situation'' had been declared in Leninakan
and Spitak to give the Soviet army power to maintain peace.
   Michael Hurley, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said
today that Soviet rescuers had requested mass quantities of plastic
sheets for use as temporary shelters.
   Medical experts say it is already too late to help the countless
thousands of people who remain trapped under rubble and that relief
efforts must focus on the hurt and homeless. Ryzhkov has pledged to
keep searching for survivors as long as it was possible.
   In Nalbanb, with a prequake population of 4,200 residents have
already buried 2,800 of the dead.
   The reconstruction effort needed in areas flattened by the quake
will cost an estimated $8 billion, Ryzhkov said.
   In Tokyo, Japan has canceled plans to send a 19-member relief
team to earthquake-stricken Armenia after the Soviet republic
dropped its request for the rescue workers, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said today.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Armenian government made the request but later dropped it
without giving any reason.
   Japan has donated $8 million to Armenia through the Japan Red
Cross and $813,000 worth of medical goods through the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, the official said.
   A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said today in Ankara that
the Soviet government asked Turkey not to send helicopters to
Armenia to help with earthquake relief efforts because of heavy air
traffic in the area. Turkey announced on Monday that it was ready to
send 20 helicopters and 12 cranes.
   A team from Turkey's Red Crescent Organization traveled to
Armenia Sunday with six trucks carrying 10,000 blankets, medical
supplies and 50 tons of food.
