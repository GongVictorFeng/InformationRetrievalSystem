   Israelis from both major parties reacted coldly
and sometimes angrily Thursday to the U.S. decision to open talks
with the PLO, and one official said Israel was given no advance
notice of the move.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the
rightist Likud bloc, was quoted by Israel radio as lamenting the
U.S. move. He said Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat has not changed his position despite his more moderate
language of recent weeks, the radio reported.
   ``They are cheap words and nothing more,'' Pazner was quoted as
saying.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev, a senior member of the
left-of-center Labor Party, said Arafat had made a ``small step
forward'' in his recent statements but fell short of renouncing
terror and recognizing Israel, as Washington had demanded.
   He said he doubted a planned U.S.-PLO meeting in Tunisia would
lead to substantive agreement because of the PLO's declaration of a
Palestinian state.
   ``If there is a meeting, not much will happen because the United
States is familiar enough with the problem to know that a
Palestinian state is not a solution,'' he said.
   Alon Liel, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry headed by Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres, said the Ministry was studying the
situation.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who announced the
decision Wednesday in Washington, said he had discussed it
beforehand with representatives of Israel.
   But one Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that
neither Shultz nor other U.S. officials had consulted Israel in
advance.
   Israel has shunned any contacts with the PLO regardless of its
statements on recognizing Israel, abandoning terrorism, and
accepting U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The
resolutions call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied lands and
guarantee the rights of all states in the region to have secure
borders.
   Israeli officials have contended Arafat did not fully renounce
terrorism because he praised the yearlong Palestinian uprising, in
which Arabs have engaged in violent riots and attacked Israelis with
firebombs and other makeshift weapons.
   Politicians from both Likud and Labor said Thursday they believed
the PO had not fulfilled all the U.S. conditions for a dialogue.
Likud supporters were clearly angered by the U.S. move.
   Benny Begin, a Likud parliament member and son of former prime
minister Menachem Begin, said the PLO was known to Israelis as ``a
bunch of killers,'' and their aim of destroying Israel has not
changed.
   ``From our point of view, a snake wearing a jacket and tie is
nothing but a well-dressed snake,'' he said. ``We shall not
negotiate with these people because no one is expected to choose the
method of his own execution.''
   Binyamin Netanyahu, a former U.N. ambassador and close associate
of Shamir, said the decision was a ``terrible mistake.''
   ``The United States has breached its policy (of not talking to
the PLO) and the credibility of the United States has been
compromised,'' said Netanyahu, a Likud bloc parliament member.
   ``The American government has been either duped or they are
deceiving themselves. The American government will regret what they
have done once they realize who they are dealing with,'' he said in
a telephone interview.
   The U.S. decision was welcomed, however, by a leading member of
the liberal Citizens Rights Movement, which was allied with the
Labor Party in the Nov. 1 parliament elections.
   ``It's a great victory for American policy,'' said Ran Cohen, a
parliament member of the small party. ``With this new success, we
are at the beginning of the peace process.''
   Wednesday's announcement in Washington could upset sensitive
negotiations under way between Labor and Likud over the formation of
a new coalition government.
   Peres and Shamir have been bitterly divided on the peace issue,
and their reactions to Arafat's U.N. speech in Geneva on Tuesday
showed they were also divided on the PLO.
   Shamir earlier issued an uncompromising rejection of the PLO and
of Arafat's peace bid, labeling the U.N. speech as double-talk.
   Peres, however, complimented Arafat for the peace bid by saying:
``He has learned to say peace, and I welcome this. He is learning.''
   Peres also called for a peace dialogue with Palestinians
``immediately and without the Jordanians, if they so decide, as long
as they don't shoot.''
   The Labor leader said, however, that Arafat should do more to end
terrorism.

<HEAD>Students In Pioneering Scholarship Program Beat National Graduation
Rate</HEAD>

   A pioneering private effort to help
underprivileged students get college scholarships has achieved a
graduation rate sharply above the national average, a study
concluded.
   The 21-year-old, privately financed Cleveland Scholarship
Programs released a study of its first two decades Wednesday showing
80 percent of those who got grants from the program and enrolled in
four-year colleges graduated.
   Nationally, about 50 percent of students who start college
receive their degrees, the program said.
   CSP has assisted more than 57,000 students, most from Cleveland
public high schools, since its founding. Last year 3,700 students
received specialized help applying for college admission and
scholarships, and 540 underprivileged students received grants
averaging $375.
   Under the program, counseling is available to all students but
only students from underprivileged economic backgrounds can qualify
for its direct grants.
   ``They really helped me a lot,'' said Dwight W. Newsom, 34, who
graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1976 and is now a
sales executive with a concrete supply company.
   Newsom, the first member of his family to attend college, said
CSP provided him with crucial help meeting an array of unfamiliar
college admission and scholarship requirements and deadlines.
   ``As far as filling out paperwork, it was totally new for me,''
Newsom said.
   Christina R. Milano, the program's executive director, said the
result of the survey showed that ``a private partnership can have a
major impact on assisting economically disadvantaged students. ...
They can go on to college and be very successful.''
   CSP has 21 part-time counselers who visit high schools and meet
with students to help them apply to college and seek financial
assistance from various sources. Follow-up counseling continues
through the campus years.
   The alumni study was conducted by Eugene S. Uyeki of Case Western
Reserve University among a random sample of 633 students out of the
8,205 who received direct CSP grants from 1967 to 1983.
   Eighty-five percent of those surveyed had average family incomes
of less than $25,000 and more than half were the first family member
to attend college.
   CSP calls itself the nation's oldest non-profit, privately
supported college financial aid counseling service. It has been used
as a model for similar programs in New York, Miami and other cities.

   Bill XXII, the Naval Academy's mascot goat,
has died. But the duty of goading the Midshipmen to victory on the
football field won't go to Bill XXIII, Bill XXIV or Bill XXV.
They're too ornery.
   Bill XXVI, who like his predecessors is a long-haired Angora
goat, was named the mascot after Bill XXII was found dead Tuesday in
his pen at the academy's dairy farm, said spokesman Jim Kiser.
   Bill XXII had just about reached the end of his normal life
expectancy and apparently died peacefully in his sleep, said Kiser,
who did not know how old the goat was.
   ``I hope he rests in peace after faithful service since 1979,''
the academy spokesman aid.
   Kiser said Bills XXII-XXV were retired prematurely ``because of
unfavorable dispositions.''
   That means they were normal, ornery goats and didn't have the
gentle disposition of Bill XXII or the new mascot, a youngster that
is 12 to 18 months old.
   A goat became Navy's mascot in 1893 when when El Cid was brought
from the cruiser USS New York for the fourth Army-Navy game. The
Midshipmen won that one 6-4.

<HEAD>Chairman Of World's Largest Company Resigns In Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS with five grafs to UPDATE with resignation. Pick up 6th
pvs, `The so-called...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co.,
the world's biggest company, resigned Wednesday under fire for
alleged involvement in a major business and political scandal.
   The minister of posts and telecommunications, Masaaki Nakayama,
told a news conference he accepted the resignation of the company's
chairman, Hisashi Shinto.
   Nakayama said Shinto denied any personal involvement in unethical
stock trading but accepted responsibility for actions by his
personal secretary.
   Japanese press reports said prosecutors traced about $81,000 to
Shinto's bank account from proceeds of the sale of shares in
Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real-estate subsidiary of the Recruit
conglomerate.
   Shinto on Tuesday issued a statement denying involvement in the
share transaction and said it was carried out by his personal
secretary, Kozo Murata, in 1986. Murata has since resigned as
Shinto's aide.
   The so-called Recruit scandal last week brought the resignation
of Kiichi Miyazawa as finance minister and deputy prime minister. It
has rocked Japan's business and political worlds with allegations
that government figures bought Recruit stock at low prices and made
huge profits when the company went public.
   The Recruit company allegedly sought favors by distributing
shares in Recruit-Cosmos with a guarantee of easy, tax-free profits.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, ranked as the largest corporation
in the world in terms of stock market capitalization, had business
links with Recruit, which bought two U.S.-made supercomputers from
the company and leased data communications circuits from it.
   As a former telecommunications monopoly, the company has been
partially privatized, but Shinto and all other officials of the
utility remain under regulations that it illegal for them to receive
cash or shares from private firms that it does business with.
   Shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications
giant since 1981 when it was still a government-owned monopoly. He
oversaw the privatization, which started in 1985, and then took the
title of president.
   He held that post until June this year, when he became chairman
and chief executive, and the title of president went to Haruo
Yamaguchi.
   Shinto's resignation would make him the most prominent victim in
the business world of the Recruit scandal. It has also brought the
resignation of news media executives and has broken several
political careers in addition to that of Miyazawa, who a year ago
was a major contender to be prime minister.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is on a list of prominent
politicians whose aides profited from owning Recruit-Cosmos shares,
but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the
transactions. Among the others are former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   The roots of the scandal go back to 1986, when unlisted
Recruit-Cosmos shares were offered to the prominent figures or their
aides, often to be paid for with loans from a Recruit-linked finance
company. The shares were listed for sale over the counter in October
1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value, yielding tax-free profits
when they were sold.
