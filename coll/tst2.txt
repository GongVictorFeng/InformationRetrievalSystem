   A man trapped in his disabled car in
near-zero temperatures for more than six hours stayed warm by
donning a snowmobile suit and tearing the covers off his car
upholstery to use as blankets, police said.
   Timothy Gerlesky, 22, of Carrolltown, was traveling on a rural
road north of Mount Jewett when he lost control of his car, slid off
the roadway, rolled down an embankment and struck a tree, state
police said.
   Gerlesky was unable to free himself from the car after the
accident and remained inside from about midnight Monday to 6:15 a.m.
Tuesday, police said.
   Help arrived after a motorist noticed the car's blinking
flashers, police said.
   Gerlesky was taken to Kane Commnity Hospital for treatment of a
broken leg and bruises. Hospital officials said he suffered no
frostbite or weather-related injuries.

   More than 200 of Roy Orbison's friends,
including Kris Kristofferson and Graham Nash, turned out for a
private gathering to honor the late musician.
   Celebrity guests arrived Tuesday night by limousine, many of them
shunning reporters and slipping through a back entrance to the
Wiltern Theater.
   Orbison died of a heart attack Dec. 6 in Hendersonville, Tenn.,
at the age of 52.
   ``He was an unbelievable vocalist,'' said Nash as he went into
the theater. ``I'm here to pay tribute, to feel his presence, and to
say goodbye.''
   The evening was highlighted by performances from Bonnie Raitt,
J.D. Souther and Brian Setzer, playing with his band, The Stray Cats.
   But a reunion of the remaining members of Orbison's last band,
The Traveling Wilburys, did not materialize. Tom Petty and Jeff
Lynne, two of the Wilburys, watched the evening's performances but
did not take the stage, publicists said.
   Barbara Orbison, the singer's widow, delivered an emotional
recollection of the performer's life, saying Orbison was very happy
at the time of his death and appreciated the popularity of his music.
   At a memorial service last weekend in Gallatin, Tenn., 75 of
Orbison's friends attended a 30-minute tribute where he was
eulogized as a legendary performer with a world-wide following.
   Orbison was best remembered as a versatile singer-songwriter,
with a range from upbeat songs such as ``Oh, Pretty Woman'' to moody
ballads like ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Blue Bayou.''

<HEAD>Planeloads of Medical Supplies Head for Soviet Earthquake Survivors</HEAD>

   Three planeloads of medical supplies for earthquake survivors in
Soviet Armenia departed California and a Red Cross charter crossed
the country to pick up supplies donated by major drug companies as
relief efforts continued.
   Fifty cartons of medicine and equipment gathered by the Armenian
Relief Society in San Francisco left Travis Air Force Base Tuesday
night aboard an Aeroflot jetliner normally used by Soviet INF Treaty
inspectors, said Lt. Col. Jim Dilda.
   Two other relief planes left Los Angeles International Airport
earlier Tuesday for the stricken region where at least 55,000 are
believed dead and 13,000 injured.
   A Soviet Aeroflot Ilyushin C-76, the first permitted to land at
the airport in a decade, left for the Armenian capital of Yerevan
with 30 tons of orthopedic equipment, pharmaceuticals and other
medical equipment worth $600,000. The supplies had been donated by
the Monrovia-based World Vision International, a Christian relief
organization.
   ``We're sending whatever they need. We are collecting money,
medicine, whatever they need,'' said Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian,
prelate of the Western Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
   A Flying Tigers 747 carried 50 tons of medicine, burn kits,
splints, blankets and generators to the disaster area. The flight
also took about 70 doctors, nurses and medical technicians from
Medical Teams International of Portland, Ore.
   The American Red Cross charter departed Anchorage, Alaska, and
planned stops in Chicago and New York today to pick medicine donated
by pharmaceutical makers before heading for Yerevan.
   ``This was a rush job to get this whole thing put together,''
said Terry Gautier, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
   Eli Lilly Co. donated $1.25 million in antibiotics to the mercy
mission, and Indiana State Police troopers escorted the shipment
from the company's Indianapolis headquarters to O'Hare International
Airport while Red Cross officials held the plane.
   G.D. Searle & Co. said it gave 300,000 tablets of the
anti-infective drug flagyl worth $350,000. The drug is used to treat
diseases such as amoebic dysentery, which may result from
contaminated food or water.
   The flight, the fourth assembled by the American Red Cross this
week, eventually will carry 75,000 pounds of supplies worth $3
million, including syringes, intravenous solutions and plastic
sheeting for constructing emergency shelters, Gaultier said.
   Robert Vessey, the group's national director of disaster
services, is scheduled to meet the aircraft in New York and travel
to the Soviet Union, she said.
   Relief workers also were loading a charter plane in Maryland with
6,000 cartons of aid, including $1.3 million in drugs and medical
supplies donated by drug companies. The flight is scheduled to leave
Dulles International Airport Friday.
   ``The essential items _ the medicine _ will go first and whatever
room is left will be for blankets, shoes, baby food, peanut butter,
canned meat products and beans,'' Peter Petrossian, head of the
Armenian Association of Baltimore, said Tuesday evening. ``Whatever
we can't get on the first plane we'll put on the next planes Sunday
and Monday.''
