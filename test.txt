   Vice President George Bush, far ahead of Sen. Bob
Dole in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, said
Friday he will stick to his game plan in the White House campaign
and declared, ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any
running mates.''
   With the latest Associated Press tally showing Bush with 788
delegates to Dole's 178, Dole was downbeat as he told the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in Washington, ``I think it's probably a
foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side.''
   The Kansas senator, telling reporters, ``I can read the numbers
and I know probably what's going to happen,'' suggested he was
re-evaluating his campaign, but his spokesman said the candidate
isn't ready to abandon the race.
   Bush, after a speech at the University of Denver, said, ``I
don't see any reason to change any game plan that we have.'' The
vice president added: ``This doesn't say it's over. So I'm going to
just keep going right down to the wire and not speculate on
somebody else's campaign or on the Democratic side.''
   Asked whether he would consider Dole as a running mate, Bush
said, ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any running
mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I
don't want to do.''
   He commented after addressing an estimated 1,000 supporters who
went to a fieldhouse to see Bush and his family and have a lunch of
chili, crackers, brownies, iced tea and lemonade.
   Meanwhile in Washington, White House chief of staff Howard H.
Baker Jr. was asked on Cable News Network's ``Evans & Novak'' if he
would accept the vice presidency if Bush turned to him.
   ``It's not just going to happen. That isn't going to occur,''
Baker said. ``George Bush needs to find someone who will bring
strength to the ticket on a regional and political basis, and I
think that is not going to be me.''
   He mentioned former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, California
Gov. George Deukmejian, and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean as good
choices for the vice presidential slot.
   Despite this, when pressed as to whether he would refuse the
position if it was offered, Baker said, ``I didn't say that. Nobody
says that who spent 20 years in politics.
   ``You know, most of my adult life I've spent in public service,
and if someone asked me to do it, I would have a very difficult
time trying to figure out what I was going to say,'' he said.
   ``But I do not wish that to happen. I do not think that will
happen, and I do not expect it.''
   Earlier in the day, Bush arrived at the Colorado Springs
Municipal Airport where he spoke briefly to about 300 people before
flying to Buckley Air National Guard Base in Aurora and going by
motorcade to Denver.
   Bush stopped in Colorado in a search for support in the state's
April 4 GOP caucuses.
   The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees will
represent the ``difference between night and day,'' Bush said at
the university. ``The country does not want to swing left to that
Democratic gloom-and-doom liberal philosophy, and we're not going
to do it,'' he said.
   Bush told reporters he is unsure whether the cease-fire
agreement in Nicaragua will work. ``I am skeptical,'' he said. ``I
hope it works. I hope peace can come and with it, democracy and
freedom. Those two have to be together.''
   ``You can't have a peace that ends up with the Soviets ending up
with a base in Central America. The American people are not as
supportive of our initiatives with the Contras as I'd like to think
the facts dictate. But they are strongly supportive of the concept,
overwhelming so, that the Soviets should not have another
stronghold in this hemisphere,'' he said.
   In Colorado Springs, Bush pledged strong support for the
Strategic Defense Initiative or ``Star Wars'' space defense
program, which is being developed in that city.
   ``Isn't it better to put weapons at risk rather than human lives
at risk?'' he asked. ``We can do it technologically.''
   Bush also brushed aside questions involving the Iran-Contra
affair and what impact it would have on his political future,
saying Americans are not concerned about that issue.
   ``The Democrats are short of real issues, bringing it up over
and over again. No one is even suggesting I have done anything
wrong,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Linkletter Preparing for Brisbane Expo</HEAD>

   The top American representative at Brisbane's
Expo '88 will be one of the few Americans who can claim to be a
specialist in both world's fairs and in Australia.
   Art Linkletter is preparing to travel Down Under to play his new
role of commissioner general of the American pavilion, with the
rank of ambassador.
   ``I have a background of half a dozen years in world's fairs,
which is really very unusual, because it's not what you might call
a regular profession,'' the veteran radio and television
entertainer said at a news conference Thursday.
   A half century ago, he said, he left a comfortable job at a
California radio station to spend ``a very happy seven or eight
months'' organizing radio events at the San Diego-Pacific
International Exposition. That led to a similar job at the Texas
Centennial in Dallas and finally to more than two years at the San
Francisco World's Fair on the eve of World War II.
   Linkletter started acquiring his Australian expertise with a
``great fiasco,'' he said, participating in a rice-growing venture
in the bush near Darwin that became a kitchen for millions of
crop-devouring geese.
   But he stayed on to operate sheep and cattle stations that took
him to Australia annually for the past 30 years. ``I know Australia
quite well,'' he said, ``I am very, very fond of Australians and
the whole country.''
   The April 30-Oct. 30 Brisbane exposition will ``give a fresh
look to world's fairs'' with its theme of leisure and technology,
he said. This is especially appropriate, since Australians spend
the most of any country on sports, equipment ``and the fun of
sports,'' Linkletter said.
   The theme of the U.S. pavilion is sports and sports science.
   Linkletter, 75, said his own devotion to fitness and daily
exercise further qualifies him for the Brisbane post. He said he
skis six weeks a year, swims and plays tennis but has not yet taken
up golf because ``I'm not old enough.''
   In show business he directed or appeared in a series of
successful radio and tv programs including ``People are Funny,''
``Art Linkletter's House Party,'' and ``Kids Say the Darndest
Things.''
   He has written several books, including ``Linkletter Down
Under,'' about Australia, and the most recent, ``Old Age is Not for
Sissies.'''
   In addition to sports industry exhibits, and daily
demonstrations of gymnastics and smaller team sports at Brisbane,
``we are going to have such things as deaf basketball players and
wheelchair'' athletes in demonstrations of sports for the
handicapped plus continuous workshops in many areas of amateur and
professional sports and recreation, he said.
   Arrangements may be made for some U.S. stars of the Seoul
Olympics to appear at Brisbane on their way home from South Korea,
Linkletter said. Also there will be a modern health club, along
with marching bands and many U.S. groups ``who are raising their
own money and paying their way,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Real' Price Of Wheat Lowest Since Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department economist says
farmers could be forced to accept the squeeze between costs and
prices as a permanent way of life if wheat price trends are an
indicator of how the farm economy may develop in the future.
   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service says
farmers ``make more money when they become more efficient, they
expand, or their terms of trade improve.''
   Advances in technology have boosted yields of crops and
livestock. Farms have gotten larger because of people leaving the
land. But prices farmers get in relation to costs have tended
downward over the years.
   Thus, Edwards said, two of the three ingredients for
profitability have been working for farmers. But the third _ prices
_ has worked against them. That results in the ``cost-price
squeeze'' that has chewed on the farm economy for generations.
   Edwards, who is economics editor of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, examined the price history of a single commodity _ wheat
_ since 1800.
   Rising prices reflected growth in domestic and export demand
from the beginning of the 19th century through the Civil War, which
included inflated prices triggered by shortages during the 1861-65
war years.
   ``From then on, for more than a century, U.S. agriculture has
shown a capacity to grow faster than its markets, and the trend in
real wheat prices has been downward, with cycles from wars and
depressions,'' Edwards said.
   In economic parlance, the ``real'' price of a commodity includes
an adjustment for inflation. The ``nominal'' price does not include
an inflation adjustment.
   During World War I, wheat prices spiked higher, but still were
below the Civil War peak. In the 1920s, wheat prices declined as a
farm depression took hold. Further downward pressure came in the
Great Depression of the 1930s.
   Wheat prices rose again in World War II but were still below the
levels of World War I.
   ``The real price (of wheat) fell from its World War II high
throughout most of the 1950s and 1960s,'' Edwards said. ``There was
a gradual downtrend in the nominal price, and inflation picked up,
particularly since 1965.''
   But prices received by farmers in the '50s and '60s were
steadied by ``massive government programs'' which boosted the U.S.
domestic price of wheat above the world price, he said.
   As fears of global hunger and grain shortages developed in the
early 1970s, wheat prices were driven up to record levels and
heralded a return to wide annual fluctuations, Edwards said. Even
so, the real price of wheat at its 1973 peak was below the World
War II high point.
   Wheat prices dropped in 1986, reflecting changes in federal
supports authorized by the 1985 farm law, he said. That allowed
lower market prices to induce more export and domestic use, while
maintaining farm income through direct payments to growers.
   ``The price is edging up a little this year,'' Edwards said.
``Even so, the real price of wheat is well below what it was at the
depth of the depressed 1930s, and the lowest it has been since
Revolutionary times. At the same time, wheat yield per acre now is
about three times what it was in the 1930s, and the wheat acreage
per farm growing wheat is 10 times what it was.''
   Edwards acknowldged that wheat accounts for ``a small percentage
of total food outlays'' by American consumers and that the margin
between the farm value of wheat and the final food product has been
growing as a result of higher transportation, processing, packaging
and other costs.
   ``Therefore, a stable consumer price is consistent with a
decreasing wheat price,'' he said. ``Even so, wars, depressions and
food crises are reflected in the price of wheat, and the price of
wheat may be a useful proxy for long-run farm and food price
trends.''
   If that is the case, Edwards said those who think that farm
prices in the coming decades will rise relative to costs ``are
calling for a fundamental change in the long-run trend.''
   He added: ``It would appear more reasonable to expect farmers
(and help them when necessary) to continue to find ways to make a
living in the face of prospective long-run cost price squeeze, as
they have done for the last century.''

   Existing organizations and private funds could
help the federal government move ahead in rural development, says
Bob Bergland, executive vice president and general manager of the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
   A partnership between private and public interests is necessary
because rural communities must not be left behind as the U.S.
economy continues to change and grow, he told the Senate Budget
Committee on Thursday.
   ``Unfortunately, many of these communities have experienced
rapid declines during the last several years,'' Bergland said in
his statement.
   Loss of population, sluggish job growth, high unemployment or
underemployment, poverty and an education gap were cited as major
problems.
   Bergland, who was secretary of agriculture in the Carter
administration, said the association he represents is an example of
existing networks that can be used to help with rural development.
The NRECA, he said, provides service to 25 million people in 2,600
counties in 46 states.
   ``Today, the problems facing many rural communities have spurred
electric cooperatives to increase their initiatives and activities
in community and economic development,'' he said.
   Bergland recommended that the Rural Electrification
Administration in the Agriculture Department be authorized to make
financing available to REA borrowers for rural development of
business, industry and public works.
   REA is the federal government's chief lending agency for the
rural electric and telephone cooperatives.
   The financial assistance could take the form of guarantees,
loans, grants and the ability to create private revolving funds, he
said. REA borrowers then could be encouraged to put together
financial packages that would ``leverage federal funds with private
capital.''
